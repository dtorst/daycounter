# daycounter

A lightweight demo that lets you select a reason and date, then remembers your
choices on the same device by saving them to `localStorage` (with a cookie
fallback when storage is unavailable).

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. Your selections for the **Reason**,
**Month**, **Day**, and **Year** dropdowns are saved automatically and restored
on your next visit.
